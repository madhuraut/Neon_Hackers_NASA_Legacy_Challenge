      "When all the  possible  error  sources  in the experiment  are  considered,  the only error  source  that  can  affect  the  physical  measurements of the  diffraction  pattern  when the object is stationary is the  location of the  zeros on the  microdensitometer  traces. The  conclusion is that the observed  radical  changes  in  the  physical  dimensions of the diffraction  patterns are due  solely  to  object  motion. It is further  concluded  that a close correlation  exists  between  the  observed  changes  in  physical  dimensions  and  the  changes predicted by this  study.  The  purpose of this  study  was  to  establish  the  existence of the correlation;  future  studies  can,  no  doubt,  refine  the  technique  used  in  this  study. CONCLUSIONS This  study  has  shown  that  it is possible  to  use  the  in-line  Fraunhofer  scheme  to form a continuous-exposure  hologram of an  object  in  motion.  The  study  has  also given  an  expression  for  the  recorded  fringe  pattern.  This  expression  shows  the  effect of the  object  motion  upon  the  usually  recorded  fringes  which  are  proportional  to  the object  geometry.

The  equipment  used was as follows. 1. The  light  source was a continuous-wave  helium-neon  laser which operated  at a 6328-angstrom  wavelength. 2. The  object  was  an  opaque  wire,  approximately 109 microns in diameter, which  moved  into  the  page  (fig. 3) with a variable  velocity  v. 3. The  object  was  transported by means of a linear  actuator  with a lead of 0. 1 inch  per  revolution. 4. The  linear  actuator  was  driven by a motor  shaft  which  could  be  varied  from a speed of 0 to 5000 rpm. 5. A 35-millimeter  camera  was  used in the  recording  (7-plane.  The  exposure time  was 1/125 of a second,  and  the  film was type  SO-233. 6. The  formation  distance  z1 was 94 centimeters.

Several  experiments  were  performed  with all system  parameters,  except  the object  velocity,  kept  constant.  Each  experiment  was  performed  twice,  once at maxi- mum laser intensity  and  once at lower laser intensity.  Table I shows  the  experiments performed  and  the  controls  on  each  experiment. 17 Reasonable  expectations of the  state of the art in  pulsed-laser  technology  with controllable  pulse  widths  would  indicate  pulse  widths of approximately 1 microsecond. Then if, for example,  1-millimeter  objects  were  measured  for  their  velocities,  the highest  measurable  velocity  would be 10  km/sec. Use of objects as large as 1 milli- meter would,  however,  require a special  lens  arrangement  to  keep  the  experiment within  the  confines of the  laboratory walls, as indicated by equation (47). Applications The  technique  presented  in  this  study  could  be  used  for a wide  range of velocity measurements of particles  in  the  micron  range. With a suitable  lens  arrangement, perhaps  larger  particles  could  be  measured.  Flow  studies could  be  made on fluids seeded  with  micron-size  particles.  The  technique would perhaps  be  most  useful  in situations  where  present  measurement  techniques  fail;  for  example, in the  measure- ment of dispersion rates of contaminants  around a spacecraft. Read-Out  Device The  experiment  results of this  study are given in terms of microdensitometer traces.  However,  because  equation  (37) is descriptive of the  fringes  recorded on the film,  there is no reason why the  resultant  hologram  cannot be reconstructed  to  produce the  image of the  path  traveled by the  object  during  the  observation  time.  Velocity measurement is an  almost  direct  measurement  because  the  path  length  divided by the exposure  time  yields  the  velocity.  This  technique  for  measuring  velocity  eliminates the  need  to know z1 and X. These two parameters, in a plane-wave  construction  and reconstruction,  control  only  the  distance  from  the  hologram  to  the  image  plane;  the image  plane  can  be  located  visually by seeking  the  sharpest  focus. EXPERIMENT RESULTS During  the  development of the  theory  discussed  in  this  report, two questions concerning  the  validity of the  two  assumptions  made  in  the  study  were  raised. 1. The  Fourier  translation  theorem is well -hewn and is accepted  for  displace- ments which  do  not vary with time.  However, is the  theorem  valid for displacements which vary with time? It was  tacitly  assumed in the  transition  from  equation  (25)  to equation  (26)  and  from  equation  (26)  to  equation  (27)  that  the  theorem  was  valid. 2. Is the  film a sufficiently  linear  recorder  to  allow  the  transition  from  equa- tion (35) to  equation  (36)  and  from  equation (36) to  equation  (37)? To  provide  the  most  convincing  answer  to  the  validity  questions,  an  experiment on a one-dimensional  object  moving  with a constant  velocity  was  designed.  The  de- vised  experiment  was  simple  for two reasons.  First,  the  experiment  was  sufficient to  resolve  the  previously  discussed  questions;  second,  the  experiment  provided an understanding of the  effect of T and V (eqs. (31)  and  (38))  upon  each  other. 16 object  during  the  observation  time T. However, if VT < d,  then T becomes  the  dom- inant  function. This condition is the  usual  situation  encountered  in  the  literature (refs.  1,.3, 4, and 5). Limiting Conditions Equation  (37) is valid  only if equation  (23) reference 1 that a further  condition  which  must  be 100d2 z <- 1- h is satisfied. It has  been  shown  in satisfied  in  Fraunhofer  holography is (44) Equation (44) must  be  satisfied in order  to  achieve a usable  signal-to-noise  ratio  in the  recorded  fringe  pattern.  From  consideration of equations  (23)  and  (44)  and of figure  2 Consideration of equation  (45)  and  figure 2 yields  the  conditions  under  which  fringes , which are proportional  to  the  object  velocity  may  be  recorded  in  the  hologram. and  since VT - R, equation  (23)  becomes The  limiting  condition  given by equation  (45) is probably of the  greatest  interest. From  the  inequality v 5 10d/T, the  highest  velocities  measurable  appear  to be subject to the fundamental  limitations of the  pulse  width  and  coherence  length of the  light source  (laser)  used.  The  inequality  appears  to  indicate  that no upper  limit  to  measur- able  velocities  exists if T is required  to  approach  zero.  However,  during  the  obser- vation  time,  enough  energy  must  still  be  supplied  to  expose  the  film; this requirement implies  use of high-power  pulsed lasers. Under  this  condition,  the  observation  time T becomes  synonymous  with  the  pulse  width of the laser. The  coherence  length  de- creases as the pulse  width  decreases,  and  ultimately,  the  coherence  length of the  light source is too  small  to  be  used  for  holography. 15 The  evaluation of equations (31) and (38) is as follows. If it is assumed  that  the  ob- ject is opaque,  then by equation (7) with K = 1 y) = -1 and which is of the form The  cross  section  in  the  5-direction is plotted  for  T in figure 2. which is of the  form The  cross  section  in  the  t-direction is plotted  for V in  figure 2. In figure 2, the  cross section is shown for  vr >> d. In this  situation,  the  object  transform  T,  which  multi- plies  the  transform of the  displacement  function of the  object V, acts as a constant of unity  with  respect  to V. Hence, V is said  to  be  dominant  and,  therefore, is recorded by the  film in preference  to T. On reconstruction of a hologram  which  was  recorded in the  situation  where v7 > d  and  which  satisfies  the  condition of equation (23), the image  which  appears in the  reconstruction  plane  will  be of the  path  traveled by the 14 . . . \n",

Attention  may  be  restricted  to  the  third  term  because  the fourth  term is simply  the  conjugate of the  third  term. In the  third  term, ohly  the  last 'two factors, T and  the  integral,  need  to  be  considered  because C is a constant  and L is a lens  term  which  controls  the  formation  distance of the  hologram of equation  (37). Distribution Functions The  two  factors of interest  appear  in  product  form  in  the  third  term of equa- tion  (37).  These two factors are and dt Both T and V are distribution  functions. If sx(t)  and s (t)  are  linear, both T and V are Fourier  transforms.  For  illustrative  purposes,  the  situation in  which  both T and V are  Fourier  transforms is considered. Y The  Fourier  transform  variables in both cases  (T  and V) are </zl and q/zl. Equation  (31)  transforms a function of x and  y,  the  object  field  in  the  xy-plane,  to a function of [/zl and  q/zl. . Equation  (38)  transforms a function of time,  the  dis- placement of the  object in the  xy-plane,  to a function of 5 z and q/zl. Because these two  functions  (eqs.  (31)  and  (38))  appear  in  product  form  in  the  [q-plane,  either equation  may  be  forced  (by  proper  control of system  parameters  in a measurement experiment)  to  be  dominant  with  respect  to  the  other.  The  dominant  equation  will  be the  one  which  produces a distribution  function  with a smaller  physical  area of interest than  the  other  equation  produces. /1 Dominant  Function To  understand how either  distribution  function  (eq.  (31)  or  (38))  may  be  forced  to be  dominant  with  respect  to  the  other  function,  figure 2 must  be  considered.  Figure 2 12 Forming  the  product  indicated by equation (34) The  following  should  be  noted  concerning  equation (35) 1. With zero  displacement  and no motion of the  object,  equation (35) reduces  to the  usual  result found  in the  literature (refs. 1, 3, and 5) for  the  problem  depicted  in figure 1. 2. If an  attempt is made  to  form a hologram,  using  the  setup  shown  in figure 1 as an  experiment  base,  the  film  does  not  record  the  intensity  given by equation (35). The  film  actually  records  the  total  energy  received;  that is, the  transmittance of the hologram (ref. 6) is proportional  to Upon performing  the  operation  indicated by equation (36), the  total  energy  dis- tribution  function  in  the  57-plane is I NTER PRETATI ON OF EQUATI  ON (37) Equation (37) consists of four  terms.  The first two terms  form a background field  which is essentially  constant. On this  background  field,  the  third  and  fourth  terms 11 1. The  ratio x/zl may  be  evaluated  from a Green's  function  solution  to  the problem  depicted  in  figure 1. The  result is (ref. 1) 2. The  lens  term 3.

      "By applying  equation  (27)  in  two-dimensional  form  to  equation (25) The  implication of equation  (28) is that  the  object,  for  integration  purposes,  may be  treated as if it were always  centered  at  the  origin of the  xy-plane.  Hence, the ob- ject  transform is a function of the  object  geometry  only.  The  displacement of the object  from  the  origin of the  xy-plane is always  performed by the  modifying term exp  ik [s c qs which appears  outside  the  integral.  The  separation of this dis- placement  term  from  the  surface  integration  over  the  object is an  important  result. This result  will  be  used in the  following  section  to  generate a distribution  function proportional  to the displacement of the  object, as a function of time,  during  the  ob- servation  period. ( x Y)/zil Energy Distribution Function Over the Observation Time in the m-Plane In this  section,  time  dependence  will  be  placed on s and s appearing  in X Y equation  (28).  The  total  field  in  the (17-plane will  be found at any  instant of time by summing  equations (8) and  (28).  For  convenience,  the  following  definitions are made. 9 since  experiment  results  indicate  that  equation (21) is adequate  to  assure  the  relative constancy of the  phase  term. Recalling  the  definition of R, it is clear that  equations  (19)  and  (20)  may  be  corn- bined  to  yield Experiment  results  indicate  that  equation  (22)  may be reduced  to Equations  (22)  and  (23)  then  reduce  to  equations  (20)  and  (21),  respectively, for the case of stationary  objects  because, by definition, R becomes  equal  to  d. Fraunhofer Integral Provided  equation  (23) is satisfied,  the  Fresnel  integral  (eq.  (16))  reduces  to exp  (-ikzl)exp s where  x  and  y  indicate  the  average  positions of the  object  center  during  the observation  time. av  av If it is imagined  that  the  coordinate  systems of figure 1 are set up so that  x av and ya, are both  equal  to  zero,  then Far-Field  Conditions Equation  (16) is the  integral  for  Fresnel  diffraction.  The  equation  for  Fraunhofer diffraction is derived  from  equation  (16) by placing  constraints  on  the  term exp[-ik(x2 + y2)/2zl] which appears  inside  the  integral. If constraints are placed on this  term  such  that  it  remains  constant (or nearly  constant),  the  term  may  be  taken  out of the  integral.  The  magnitude of this  term is always  unity,  but  its  phase  varies ac- cording  to  the  limits of integration.  These  limits are set by the  object  geometry if the object is stationary. In the  example  considered by this  study,  the  limits of integration are set by the  largest  dimension of the  loci of points  occupied by the  object  during  the observation  time.  The  definition is then R . 5 * largest  dimension of the  loci of points  occupied by the  object  during  the  observation  time (17) If the  magnitude of R is such  that  the  phase  change of the  term exp[ik(x2 + y2)/2,;] is equal  to  or  less  than 7r/2, the  phase  term  should  remain  sufficently  constant  to be removed  from  the  integral.  The  requirement is kR2 7~ 552 or In the  usual  case of stationary  objects,  the  argument R is replaced by the object  dimension  d,  and  the  result is Equation (20) is often  reduced  to (ref. 3) d2 z >-r 1 where x is an  inclination  factor  for  the  Huygens  radiator.  The  total  field is then where  the  integral is a surface  integral  with  limits  set by the  physical  limits of the object  geometry. To  evaluate  the  integral, r must  be  found  in  terms of the  coordinates.

However,  the  treatment of this  problem is fundamental  to  later  develop- ments  because  the  objective of this  study is to find  the  field  at  the 577-plane with  the object  in  motion;  hence,  the  object  will  occupy  many  positions  during  the  observation time. The symmetry of the  usual  problem has been  removed by placing  the  object off the  optical  axis, as shown in figure 1. The  physics of the  problem are understood by considering  the  object  field as a summation of a number of point  sources  and by applying  the  Huygens  principle (ref. 2). Therefore,  the  differential  field at the  [v-plane is 5 I1 II Ill I1 I1 \n",

      "OF OBJECT  MOTION IN FRAUNHOFER  HOLOGRAPHY WITH  APPLICATION TO VELOCITY  MEASUREMENTS By William P. Dotson,  Jr.* Manned  Spacecraft  Center SUMMARY This  study is concerned  with  the  development of a theory  to  describe  the  effect that  object  velocity  has upon the  recorded  fringe  pattern in Fraunhofer  holography. The  conclusion  is  that,  under  the  conditions  described,  objects  may  move as much as 10 times  their  mean  diameter  during  the  observation  time.  This  motion  produces fringes in the  hologram  which  are  descriptive of the  motion. INTRODUCTION A theoretical  analysis is made of the  time  dependence of the  intensity of the total  field  at a recording 511-plane due  to  the  interference of a constant-background field  with  the  field  diffracted by a moving  object.  This  equation is then  integrated  over the  observation  time  in  order  to  find  the  total  energy  distribution  function  in  the (11 -plane. This  study  expands  present  Fraunhofer  holography  theory  to  include  moving ob- jects, and  the  expanded  theory is reduced to  the  usual  result found  in the  literature when the  object is stationary. An experiment  was  designed  to  test  the  theory of this study  and  was  performed  successfully. The  author  extends  his  appreciation  to G. P. Bonner, N. K. Shankar,  and C. W. Wells of the  Science  and  Applications  Directorate, NASA Manned Spacecraft  Cen- ter, Houston,  Texas,  for  their  assistance  in  performing  the  laboratory  experiments.

The  in-line  Fraunhofer  hologram is analyzed  with  the  assumption that the  object  moves a significant  distance  during  the  observation  time. An equation is derived which predicts  the effect  that  object  motion  has upon the  recorded  fringe  pattern. An analysis of the  fringe pattern  recorded on the  film  consequently  yields  the  total  motion of the  object  during  the observation  time.  It is also  possible  to  reconstruct  the  resultant  hologram so that  the path  the  object  traveled  during  the  exposure  time is reproduced.  This knowledge, coupled with  the  exposure  time,  yields  the  desired  measurement of the  object  velocity. - \"~ \" 17. KEY  WORDS  (SUPPLIED BY AUTHOR) ' Laser  Velocimeter .

Dotson, Jr. Man fled Spacecraft  Cejzter Houstou, Texus NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND  SPACE  ADMINISTRATION WASHINGTON, D. C. NOVEMBER 1969 1 When all the  possible  error  sources  in the experiment  are  considered,  the only error  source  that  can  affect  the  physical  measurements of the  diffraction  pattern  when the object is stationary is the  location of the  zeros on the  microdensitometer  traces. The  conclusion is that the observed  radical  changes  in  the  physical  dimensions of the diffraction  patterns are due  solely  to  object  motion. It is further  concluded  that a close correlation  exists  between  the  observed  changes  in  physical  dimensions  and  the  changes predicted by this  study.  The  purpose of this  study  was  to  establish  the  existence of the correlation;  future  studies  can,  no  doubt,  refine  the  technique  used  in  this  study. CONCLUSIONS This  study  has  shown  that  it is possible  to  use  the  in-line  Fraunhofer  scheme  to form a continuous-exposure  hologram of an  object  in  motion.  The  study  has  also given  an  expression  for  the  recorded  fringe  pattern.  This  expression  shows  the  effect of the  object  motion  upon  the  usually  recorded  fringes  which  are  proportional  to  the object  geometry.
